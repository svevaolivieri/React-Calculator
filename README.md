The activity aims to enable users to calculate the area and perimeter of a selected shape (square or circle) in a React project via a web interface.
The user can choose the geometric shape and, depending on their choice, will be asked to enter the side or radius. 
The corresponding formula will be displayed and the background color of the wrapper component will change, which will receive and display the child components inside it.
